5. **Create a Storage Account**  
   - Within the resource group created in Step 4  
   - Go to **Storage Accounts** > **Create**  
   - Provide a unique name and select the same region.

6. **Create a Text File on Your Local Machine**  
   - Open your text editor and write a simple message

7. **Upload the File to Azure**  
   - Open your storage account in the Azure Portal  
   - Navigate to **Containers**, create one (e.g., `labfiles`), and upload the text file.

8. **Edit the File Inside the Portal**  
   - Use Azure's built-in editor to make changes to the uploaded text file.

9. **Download the File Back to Your Local Machine**  
   - Use the download option from within the storage container.

10. **Open and Observe the Changes**  
    - Confirm that edits made in Azure are reflected locally.

11. **Delete the Resource Group**  
    - Navigate to **Resource Groups**  
    - Select the group created in Step 4  
    - Click **Delete**, confirm the name, and proceed.

12. **Confirm Deletion**  
    - Ensure all associated resources (storage account, containers, files) are removed.
