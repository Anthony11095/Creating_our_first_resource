## Azure Portal Overview ‚Äì Starting Configuration

![Azure Portal - Configuration Steps Overview](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/YOUR_IMAGE_LINK.jpg)

This screenshot displays the **Microsoft Azure Portal** landing page, specifically highlighting the **Azure services** section used to begin resource setup and management.

### Key Elements Displayed:
- **Create a resource**: Entry point for launching any new Azure service (e.g., VMs, storage, databases).
- **Virtual machines**: Shortcut to manage or create virtual machines.
- **Storage accounts**: Used to access Azure Blob/File/Table/Queue storage services.
- **Resource groups**: Central management containers for logically grouping related resources.
- **Microsoft Entra ID**: Identity management section (formerly Azure Active Directory).
- **Cost Management**: Budgeting, cost analysis, and usage reporting.
- **Quickstart Center**: Guided onboarding for Azure beginners.
- **Dashboard**: Customizable workspace to pin and view Azure resources.

The lower section confirms that **no resources have been viewed recently**, indicating a fresh or reset user session.

### Purpose of This Screen

This view acts as the **launchpad** for nearly all Azure lab configurations. From this page, users can:
- Create and manage core infrastructure like resource groups and storage accounts
- Begin tracking and budgeting costs via the Cost Management service
- Access recently used items or navigate to subscriptions and dashboards

This interface is commonly used as the first step when setting up environments for hands-on labs, cloud application deployments, or cost optimization exercises.

## Creating a Resource Group in Azure

![Azure Portal - Create a Resource Group](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/YOUR_IMAGE_LINK.jpg)

This screenshot captures the process of creating a **Resource Group** within the Microsoft Azure Portal. A resource group acts as a logical container for grouping related Azure resources like virtual machines, storage accounts, and network interfaces.

### Key Interface Elements Displayed:
- **Subscription:** The selected subscription is labeled as "Active Directory."
- **Resource Group Name:** A user-defined name is expected to be entered in this field.
- **Region:** `(US) East US 2` is selected, determining the geographic location where resources in this group will be deployed.

At the bottom, a **"Review + create"** button is visible, allowing the user to validate and finalize the creation of the resource group.

### Context and Purpose

Creating a resource group is typically the **first step** in setting up cloud infrastructure in Azure. It ensures that all services and components deployed for a specific solution are organized under one manageable scope.

This foundational step allows for:
- Easier cost tracking and billing
- Simplified lifecycle management (create, modify, delete)
- Consolidated monitoring and access control via RBAC

After this step is complete, users can proceed to create and deploy other services like storage accounts or virtual machines within the same group.

<img width="1919" height="878" alt="Resource group created" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/70adfc4d-5674-4a49-b324-fe8c0325e712" />

## Resource Group Successfully Created

![Azure Portal - Resource Group View](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/YOUR_IMAGE_LINK.jpg)

This screenshot confirms that a **resource group** has been successfully created in the Microsoft Azure Portal. The resource group is now listed and visible under the **Resource groups** section of the Azure interface.

### Key Elements Displayed:
- The **Resource groups** blade is active in the portal.
- One resource group is listed under the current subscription (`Azure subscription 1`).
- The region selected for the resource group is `East US 2`.
- Sorting, filtering, and tagging options are available for organizing multiple groups.
- The **Storage accounts** blade is also visible at the bottom, indicating the next possible step.

### Confirmation and Purpose

The presence of the newly created resource group in this view confirms that the creation process was completed successfully. This group will serve as the logical container for deploying and managing related Azure services such as virtual machines, storage accounts, or networking resources.

By organizing resources within a group:
- Management is simplified through centralized controls
- Deletion or cleanup of resources is more efficient
- Billing and monitoring can be done on a per-group basis

With the resource group in place, the environment is now ready for deploying additional cloud services.

## Viewing Storage Accounts in Azure

![Azure Portal - Storage Accounts View](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/YOUR_IMAGE_LINK.jpg)

This screenshot shows the **Storage accounts** blade within the Microsoft Azure Portal. The interface currently indicates that **no storage accounts** have been created yet in the selected subscription and resource group.

### Key Elements Displayed:
- The view is filtered to show storage accounts within the resource group `Lab-Test-Anthony`.
- The message "No storage accounts to display" confirms that no accounts exist yet under this filter.
- A blue **+ Create** button is available to begin the creation of a new storage account.
- Additional filter options are shown: subscription, location, resource group, and more.
- The lower pane confirms that the resource group `Lab-Test-Anthony` is active and selected.

### Purpose and Next Step

This screen is typically used to monitor, manage, or create storage accounts in Azure. Since no storage accounts currently exist, this indicates the environment is in a clean or initial state‚Äîready for the next step.

From here, the next action is to:
- Click **+ Create** to launch the storage account creation wizard.
- Specify the resource group, region, performance tier, redundancy, and other settings.
- Use the storage account for hosting blobs, files, queues, or tables as needed for the lab or project.

This clean starting point ensures clarity when tracking new resources and managing cloud storage.

## Storage Account Successfully Created and Assigned to Resource Group

![Azure Portal - Storage Account Created](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/YOUR_IMAGE_LINK.jpg)

This screenshot shows the successful creation of a **storage account** within the **Lab-Test-Anthony** resource group in the Microsoft Azure Portal.

### Key Elements Displayed:
- The upper panel still states **"No storage accounts to display"**, which appears to be a previous view or default landing message.
- The **Lab-Test-Anthony** resource group is selected in the lower panel, confirming it's currently in focus.
- One storage account is now listed with the name `a****y11095` (partially visible for privacy).
- The **Type** is identified as `Storage account`, and the **Location** is set to `East US 2`.

### Confirmation and Significance

This confirms that a storage account has been successfully created and is associated with the active resource group. It is now available to:
- Upload, manage, and edit files (blobs, tables, queues, etc.)
- Test storage functionality such as file persistence, download, and permissions
- Proceed with hands-on activities involving file operations inside Azure Storage

The storage account can now be accessed directly to create containers or upload text files for lab testing.

## Creating a Text File for Azure Storage Upload

![Local Text File Created - Ready for Upload](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/YOUR_IMAGE_LINK.jpg)

This screenshot shows a locally created **text file** named `azure-lab.txt` open on the user's desktop environment, specifically within the **Documents** folder on OneDrive. The file contains a simple message: `Hello`.

### Key Elements Displayed:
- The file is named `azure-lab.txt` and saved in plain text format (`.txt` extension).
- The text editor being used is Notepad or a similar plain text editor.
- Encoding is shown as `UTF-8`, and the file format is `Plain text`.
- Azure Storage Account blade is open in the background, showing the `anthony11095` storage account and an active container creation pane.

### Purpose of This Step

This step demonstrates the creation of a **simple text file** on the local machine, which will later be:
1. Uploaded to an Azure Storage container
2. Edited directly within the Azure Portal
3. Downloaded again to verify successful changes and round-trip file handling

Creating and using a plain text file is an effective way to validate Azure Blob Storage functionality and test file manipulation capabilities in a controlled lab environment.
